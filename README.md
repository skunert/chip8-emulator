 # Chip 8 Emulator
 This repository contains an emulator for the Chip8 architecture. I followed the reference by CowGod http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM.
 I used it as a learning project to get familiar with Rust and Emulator internals.

# How to run
Find yourself a Chip8 rom (pong is included). 
Clone the project and run `cargo run PATH_TO_ROM`

# Dependencies
You need to install [sdl2](www.libsdl.org) from the package manager of your choice.
